# vue-todo

Simple todo app to learn Vue.js
CRUD with MongoDB.
-- Added Vuex.

### Things I liked about Vue.
EventBus was nice and simple. ~~I'll try Vuex this week.~~ I felt Vuex is simpler and easier than Redux(Just my opnion). 
I feel like handling state is easier than React.
But I may feel it is hard to read as an app gets complicated. (I am not used to Vue yet.)
So far I like it.

#### Client folder
npm run dev

#### Server folder

place your MONGODB URL in .env file.
